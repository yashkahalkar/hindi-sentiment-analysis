### ‚ú® Features

-   **üìù Text-Based Analysis:** Input Hindi text in Devanagari script to get an instant emotion prediction.
-   **üé§ Speech-Based Analysis:** Upload Hindi audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`) to transcribe the speech and analyze its emotional content.
-   **ü§ñ Multi-Class Classification:** Goes beyond simple positive/negative sentiment to predict a range of emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, and more.
-   **üíª Interactive Web Interface:** A clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit, making the complex backend models accessible to everyone.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern, decoupled architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

* **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - For creating the interactive web application.
* **Speech-to-Text (ASR):** [OpenAI Whisper (base model)](https://openai.com/research/whisper) - For highly accurate Hindi audio transcription.
* **Text Embeddings:** [Google Gemini API (`embedding-001`)](https://ai.google.dev/) - To convert text into rich, semantic vector representations.
* **Classifier:** [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - A Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained for multi-class emotion classification.
* **Model Hosting:** [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) - For storing the trained SVM model artifact, decoupled from the application code.
* **Deployment:** [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) - For continuous deployment directly from GitHub.
